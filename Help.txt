PAINT ON IT! HELP

1.	Select any mesh or terrain object in the scene (you may select multiply objects but only the last one will be painted).

2.	Go to menu GoToSolutions -> Paint On It...

3.	Select brush object in opened window.

4.	Paint on it!

5.	When finished, close the tool (Presently the tool creates temporary mesh collider and removes it on close).


Enjoy!
